## Purpose
Many procrastinators have difficulty managing their time, thus the need to reflect upon how one's day is spent. This is a website that allows individuals to visualize how they spend their time on a typical 24-hour day. Users are allowed to add hours to six different tasks and see how a normal day is spent broken up into separate parts.

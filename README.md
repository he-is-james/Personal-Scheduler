## Purpose
Many procrastinators have difficulty managing their time, thus the need to reflect upon how one's day is spent. This is a website that allows individuals to visualize how they spend their time on a typical 24-hour day. Users are allowed to add hours to six different tasks and see how a normal day is spent broken up into separate parts.
## Errors
- Viewing of the grid layout on different devices
- Manually typing a value into the input boxes does not alter the bars or change remaining hours
- Unfinished version does not include ideal scenario for the user or endscreen after completing the journey
